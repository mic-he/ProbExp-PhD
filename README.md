# Investigating the Language of Uncertainty

Public repository for my PhD [dissertation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12v1q6T8gxjQL5GVq0u9KL72F3Hn-Tzdo/view?usp=sharing) (defended!). It contains:

- Experiments: psiTurk (HTML+JS) implementations of four experimental studies run on Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

- Data: raw data (anonymized) as CSV files.

- R files: scripts for data cleaning, exploration and visualizations, as well as (Bayesian) data analysis and JAGS implementation of the models.
