Public repository for my PhD dissertation. It contains:

- Experiments: psiTurk (HTML+JS) implementations of four experimental studies run on Amazon's Mechanical Turk.

- Data: raw data (anonymized) as CSV files.

- R files: scripts for data cleaning, exploration and visualizations, as well as (Bayesian) data analysis and JAGS implementation of the models.
