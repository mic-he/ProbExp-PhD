# measuring posterior beliefs about the content of an urn
participants know that an urn contains 10 red and blue balls but they don't know the exact quantities

they can draw a certain number of balls, look at them, and make a guess about the exact content

to measure this guess, we ask participants to adjust 11 sliders, one for each possible quantity of red balls in the urn, ranging from impossible to certain
