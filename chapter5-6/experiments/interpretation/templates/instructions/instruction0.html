        <p> We start with a short tutorial in which you play as sender.</p>
        <p> As a sender, you observe a number of balls, then put them back into the urn and then draw a new ball from the urn.</p>
        <p> We will use pictures to represent these situations.</p>
        <p>Please look at the pictures in the following screens, and choose which message you want to send.</p>
