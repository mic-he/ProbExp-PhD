        <p>This concludes your training. In the actual experiment, you will play as a sender.</p>
        <p> As a sender, you observe a number of balls, then put them back into the urn and then draw a new ball from the urn.</p>
        <p> We use pictures to represent these situations. Here's an example:</p>
        
        <p align="left">
            <table class='tg2'>
                <tr>
                    <th class="th1"><img src="/static/images/first.png"></th>
                    <th class="th1"><img src="/static/images/63.png"></th>
                    <th class="th1"><img src="/static/images/63back.png"</img></th>
                    <th class="th1"><img src="/static/images/last.png"></th>
                </tr>
            </table>
        </p>
